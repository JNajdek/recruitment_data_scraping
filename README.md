Instruction:

In this project, the database was made in PostreSQL, which must be installed for the application to work properly.

Before running the application, create the PostreSQL database so that its name, password and username match those in the

.\src\main\resources\application.properties file. You should change the name, password and username in the application.properties file

 to match those in the database.
